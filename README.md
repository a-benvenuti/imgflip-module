# My First Custom Drupal 9 Module #

### Description: ###
- The module contains a custom page that takes data from 'https://api.imgflip.com/get_memes' and renders the images and titles.
- Using the twig extension it adds a suffix "Meme:" to the title.
- The page that displays the memes is located in the config menu and is displayed only by users who have the 'view_meme_list' role.
- The module has a configuration that indicates the number of memes to show on the page.
